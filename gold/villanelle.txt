Seven days later, the journey is done
With so many people who I'd got to meet
Ending more upbeat than I had begun

A trip up the mountain to work in the sun
With hours of sitting on a bony bus seat
Seven days later, the journey is done

I'd never expect to have had so much fun
Each day spent toiling in midsummer heat
Ending more upbeat than I had begun

Hearing unique little stories from everyone
And knowing that listening is never complete
Seven days later, the journey is done

Learning to pause where before I might run
An unfamiliar place and a steady heartbeat
Ending more upbeat than I had begun

Despite the exhaustion I've undoubtedly won
A stockpile of memories I'll never deplete
Seven days later, this great journey is done
I'm ending more happy than when I'd begun
